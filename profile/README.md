# void(1): Next Generation Infrastructure for the Web

## Our Projects
- [VoidOne Platform](https://voidone.dev/) - Infrastructure service for the web
- [VoidOne CLI](https://github.com/voidone-dev/cli) - The fastest CLI for deployments

## About

We are building the next generation of web infrastructure that is:

- **Lightning Fast**: Our global edge network spans 120+ countries, delivering sub-second load times and accelerated API responses for your applications.
- **Developer-First**: Deploy with a single command (`npx voidone deploy`) or drag-and-drop upload. No server management needed - we handle the complex infrastructure so you can focus on building.
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built with industry-leading security features including Transport Layer Security, DDoS Protection, SSL, and Strict Transport Security.
- **Full Stack Capable**: Beyond static deployments, our platform supports:
  - **Serverless Functions**: Deploy JavaScript functions as production-ready API endpoints *(coming soon)*
  - **Serverless Database**: Managed database solution for your applications *(coming soon)*
  - **AI Endpoints**: Scale to hundreds of GPU instances with pay-per-second billing *(in development)*
